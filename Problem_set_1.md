# GitHub-Style Markdown Report

## Introduction

This report provides an analysis of code snippets related to various tasks, including data loading, linear transformation, and neural network training. Each section discusses a specific aspect of the code.

## Loading MNIST and Creating Montage

The following code section loads the MNIST dataset and visualizes a montage of images from the training set:

```python
# Load MNIST Montage

# ...

# Visualization of a montage of MNIST images
montage_plot(X[125:150, 0, :, :])
```

## Linear Transformation and Classification

In this section, the code performs a random linear transformation (\(y = mx\)) on the MNIST dataset and evaluates classification accuracy:

```python
# Run random y=mx

# ...

# Linear transformation and classification
# ...
```

## GPU Acceleration

This section introduces GPU acceleration using PyTorch and applies linear transformation and classification using GPU tensors:

```python
# GPU Acceleration

# ...

# Linear transformation and classification with GPU
# ...
```

## Fine-Tuning Linear Transformation for Improved Accuracy

The code fine-tunes a linear transformation to enhance accuracy. It iteratively updates the weight matrix \(M\) to improve predictive performance:

```python
# Fine-tuning linear transformation for improved accuracy

# ...

# Training the linear model with fine-tuned weights
# ...
```

## PyTorch Neural Network Training

In the final sections, PyTorch's capabilities for training neural networks are demonstrated. A model is initialized, a loss function is defined, and optimization using stochastic gradient descent is performed:

```python
# PyTorch Neural Network Training

# ...

# Training a PyTorch neural network model
# ...
```
