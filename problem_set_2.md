# Image Processing Report
In this report, we will document the steps involved in processing an image, including resizing, grayscale conversion, and convolution with random filters. We will use the code provided and visualize the outputs at each step.

You can find the code and the entire process in this Google Colab Notebook[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17CntMWGmxQa0gnsV-BJiu1CEo9Ei_--r?usp=sharing].
